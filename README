Instructions:

Type 'lab4' into the linux command line
this will run the executable.

To rebuild the contents of this lab, type
'make clean' into the linux command line
to wipe releveant contents. Then type
'make' to rebuild the executable.

Expected Results:

The writer threads read from two separate files,
writerFile1 and writerFile2. Upon successful execution
(the program will inform the user whether execution was
successful or not just before it exits), the account
balances should read as follows:

    acc1 bal = 654.2
    acc2 bal = 185
    acc3 bal = 95.47

Warning:

When the program runs, it may at first glance seem to be
an infinte loop. This is due to the non-deterministic nature
of the OS's scheudling routine. If you pay attention to the
balances being read, the will be changing over time as writers
periodically gain access to change the balance. Rest assured
the execution will complete, usually within a couple minutes.
